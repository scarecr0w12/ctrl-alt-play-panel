# Frequently Asked Questions

This document addresses common questions about the Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel project.

## General Questions

### What is Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel?

Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel is an advanced game server management platform that uses a distributed Panel+Agent architecture. It allows you to manage multiple game servers across different nodes from a single web interface. The system supports various game servers, provides plugin management, Steam Workshop integration, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

### What makes Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel different from other server panels?

Key differentiators include:
- **Panel+Agent Distributed Architecture**: Separates management from execution for better scalability and fault isolation
- **Multi-Database Support**: Works with PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, and SQLite
- **Zero-Dependency Design**: Runs on any Linux distribution without additional requirements
- **Environment-Agnostic Testing**: Complete external service mocking for consistent test execution
- **Advanced Plugin System**: Marketplace integration with certification process
- **Steam Workshop Integration**: Direct integration for game content management
- **Dynamic Port Management**: Automatic port conflict resolution

### Which operating systems are supported?

The Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel supports:
- **Panel Server**: Any Linux distribution, Windows, macOS
- **Agent Nodes**: Linux distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, Alpine, etc.)
- **Development**: Cross-platform development on Linux, Windows, macOS

### What are the system requirements?

**Minimum Requirements**:
- 2 CPU cores
- 4GB RAM
- 20GB disk space
- Node.js 18 or higher
- Docker (for containerized deployments)

**Recommended Requirements**:
- 4+ CPU cores
- 8GB+ RAM
- 50GB+ disk space
- SSD storage
- Dedicated server or VPS

## Installation Questions

### How do I install Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel?

The project offers three installation methods:

1. **One-Command Auto Setup**:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scarecr0w12/ctrl-alt-play-panel/main/quick-deploy.sh | bash
   ```

2. **Interactive CLI Wizard**:
   ```bash
   ./easy-setup.sh
   ```

3. **Web Installer**: Access the web-based installation wizard after basic setup

### Can I install without Docker?

Yes, while Docker is recommended for production deployments, you can run the Panel and Agents directly on the host system. However, Docker provides better isolation, easier management, and consistent environments.

### How do I configure multiple databases?

The system supports multiple database backends through environment configuration:

1. Set `DATABASE_TYPE` in your `.env` file (postgresql, mysql, mongodb, sqlite)
2. Configure the appropriate connection string in `DATABASE_URL`
3. Run migrations: `npx prisma migrate deploy`

## Architecture Questions

### What is the Panel+Agent architecture?

The distributed architecture separates concerns:
- **Panel**: Central management interface and API backend
- **Agents**: Distributed execution nodes that manage game servers

Benefits include:
- Scalability across multiple nodes
- Fault isolation (agent failures don't affect panel)
- Independent resource management
- Better security through separation

### How do Panel and Agents communicate?

Communication happens through:
- **HTTP REST API**: For standard operations
- **WebSocket**: For real-time events and console streaming
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based communication
- **Automatic Discovery**: Agents automatically register with the Panel

### Can I run multiple Agents on the same machine?

Yes, you can run multiple Agents on the same machine by configuring different ports for each Agent. This is useful for:
- Testing multiple configurations
- Isolating different game server types
- Resource allocation control

## Security Questions

### How is authentication handled?

The system uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with these security features:
- **httpOnly Cookies**: Prevents XSS attacks
- **Secure Flags**: Encryption in production
- **SameSite Protection**: CSRF prevention
- **Role-Based Access Control**: 36 granular permissions
- **Session Management**: Tracking and revocation

### What security measures are in place?

Key security features include:
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (Prisma ORM)
- XSS protection (Content Security Policy)
- Rate limiting
- File operation validation
- Console command filtering
- Container security (non-root users, read-only filesystem)

## Plugin Questions

### How do I create a plugin?

Use the plugin CLI tool:
```bash
npx cap-plugin create my-plugin
```

This generates a plugin template with:
- Standard directory structure
- Configuration files
- Example implementation
