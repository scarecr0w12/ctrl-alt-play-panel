# Immediate Action Plan - Ctrl-Alt-Play Development

## Current Status: Panel-Only Project Focus

Ctrl-Alt-Play has been refactored to focus solely on the **Panel Server** component. The agent system is now a separate project that will connect to this panel via WebSocket.

*Developed by [scarecr0w12](https://github.com/scarecr0w12)*

## 🚨 Project Scope Clarification

### Single-Process Architecture (Panel Only)

**🎛️ Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel Server** (This Project)
- **Purpose**: Web interface, user management, configuration storage, agent coordination
- **Deployment**: Docker container OR direct server installation  
- **Components**:
  - REST API for web interface
  - WebSocket server for agent communication (port 8080)
  - PostgreSQL database for persistent storage
  - Redis for caching and session management
- **Communication**: Receives connections from external agents

**🤖 Agent System** (Separate Project - Not Included)
- Standalone projects that connect to this panel
- Installed directly on game server hosts
- Manage local Docker containers
- Report back to panel via WebSocket

2. ✅ **Agent Protocol: WebSocket communication protocol** defined and tested
3. ✅ **Database Layer: Complete CRUD operations** for all entities
4. ✅ **API Endpoints: All REST endpoints** functional and tested
5. ✅ **Agent Integration: Mock agent** successfully connecting and communicating

## 🔧 Development Commands Reference (Panel-Only)

```bash
# Panel Development (Web Interface & Agent Coordinator)
npm run dev                          # Start panel web server with hot reload
npm run build                        # Build panel TypeScript
docker-compose up -d                 # Start panel dependencies (postgres, redis)

# Database Operations
npm run migrate                      # Run database migrations
npm run db:generate                  # Generate Prisma client
npm run db:reset                     # Reset database with fresh schema

# Testing
npm test                            # Test panel functionality  
npm run test:watch                  # Test with file watching
docker-compose logs -f              # Monitor all services

# Production Deployment
docker-compose up -d                # Full panel deployment
# OR
npm run build && npm run start      # Direct deployment
```

## 🚧 Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Project Structure**: Clean panel-only architecture
2. **TypeScript Compilation**: All errors resolved ✅
3. **Docker Configuration**: Panel services only
4. **Database Schema**: Complete Prisma models
5. **Authentication**: JWT-based auth system
6. **🆕 Development Server Setup**: Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS with Node.js 18.x ✅
7. **🆕 Environment Configuration**: Development environment ready ✅
8. **🆕 Build System**: TypeScript compilation successful ✅
9. **🆕 Development Server**: Running successfully on port 3000 ✅

### 🚧 In Progress

1. **Service Layer**: DatabaseService, AgentService, SocketService need completion
2. **API Routes**: Basic structure present, need full implementation
3. **Agent Protocol**: WebSocket message definitions needed
4. **Database Migration**: Need to set up PostgreSQL and run migrations

### ⏳ Next Priorities

1. **Database Setup**: Configure PostgreSQL and run Prisma migrations
2. **Complete Core Services**: Implement missing service methods
3. **Agent Communication**: Define and implement WebSocket protocol
4. **Testing**: Set up comprehensive test suite

## 📅 Next Steps After Week 1-2

Once foundation issues are resolved:

- **Week 3**: Complete file management and server lifecycle operations
- **Week 4**: Implement real-time monitoring and console features  
- **Week 5-6**: Begin frontend development
- **Week 7-8**: Integration testing and production preparation

## 🆘 Need Help With?

Current areas where additional development effort is needed:

1. **Frontend Framework Decision**: React vs Vue.js vs Svelte
2. **Game Server Templates**: Minecraft, Rust, CS2 Docker configurations
3. **Monitoring Integration**: Prometheus/Grafana setup
4. **Security Review**: Authentication and authorization hardening
