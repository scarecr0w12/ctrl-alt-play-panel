- Validate plugin packages before publishing
- Submit plugins to marketplace with metadata
- Track publishing workflow status
- Handle publishing errors and retries
- Manage plugin visibility and approval status

### 2. Plugin Analytics Service (`PluginAnalyticsService.ts`)
**Purpose**: Advanced analytics tracking and reporting for plugin usage, performance, and marketplace metrics

**Key Features**:
- **Event Tracking**: Downloads, installs, usage sessions, errors, ratings
- **Analytics Reports**: Comprehensive plugin performance reports
- **User Analytics**: User behavior and engagement tracking
- **Demographic Analysis**: Geographic and platform distribution
- **Performance Metrics**: Error rates, crash analysis, usage patterns

**Analytics Events Supported**:
- Plugin downloads and installations
- Usage sessions and duration tracking
- Error and crash reporting
- User ratings and reviews
- Performance metrics collection

### 3. Marketplace Dashboard Service (`MarketplaceDashboardService.ts`)
**Purpose**: Data aggregation and dashboard functionality for marketplace insights

**Dashboard Types**:
- **Marketplace Overview**: Total stats, trends, top plugins, recent activity
- **Plugin Dashboard**: Detailed plugin analytics, performance metrics, user feedback
- **User Dashboard**: Developer insights, earnings, plugin performance
- **Health Metrics**: System status, API health, service monitoring

**Data Insights**:
- Real-time marketplace statistics
- Plugin performance trends
- User engagement analytics
- Revenue and download tracking
- Geographic distribution analysis

### 4. Dashboard API Routes (`dashboard.ts`)
**Purpose**: RESTful API endpoints for accessing marketplace dashboard data

**Endpoints Implemented**:
- `GET /api/dashboard/stats` - Comprehensive marketplace statistics
- `GET /api/dashboard/plugin/:pluginId` - Detailed plugin dashboard
- `GET /api/dashboard/user/:userId` - User/developer dashboard
- `GET /api/dashboard/health` - System health metrics
- `GET /api/dashboard/overview` - Simplified overview for landing pages
- `GET /api/dashboard/trends` - Marketplace trends analysis
- `GET /api/dashboard/categories` - Category performance data
- `GET /api/dashboard/users/activity` - User activity dashboard (admin only)

## Enhanced Marketplace Routes

The existing marketplace routes (`marketplace.ts`) have been significantly extended with 8+ new endpoints:

### Publishing Workflow Endpoints
- `POST /api/integration/plugins/publish/validate` - Validate plugin packages
- `POST /api/integration/plugins/publish/submit` - Submit plugins to marketplace
- `GET /api/integration/plugins/publish/status/:workflowId` - Check publishing status
- `PUT /api/integration/plugins/publish/workflow/:workflowId` - Update workflow status

### Analytics Endpoints
- `POST /api/integration/analytics/track` - Track analytics events
- `GET /api/integration/analytics/report/:pluginId` - Generate plugin reports
- `GET /api/integration/analytics/user/:userId` - Get user analytics
- `GET /api/integration/analytics/events` - Query analytics events

## Technical Achievements

### Authentication & Security
- All dashboard endpoints protected with JWT authentication
- Role-based access control (admin-only endpoints)
- Request validation with comprehensive error handling
- User access restrictions (users can only access their own data)

### Data Integration
- Seamless integration between analytics, publishing, and dashboard services
- Real-time data aggregation from multiple sources
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Mock data systems ready for production database integration

### TypeScript Compliance
- Full TypeScript implementation with proper type definitions
