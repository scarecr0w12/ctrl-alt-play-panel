## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

**Before Reporting:**
1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Ensure you're using the latest version
3. Verify the issue hasn't been fixed in development

**Good Bug Reports Include:**
- Clear, descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, Node version, etc.)
- Relevant logs or error messages
- Screenshots if applicable

### Feature Requests

**Submitting Feature Requests:**
1. Check existing issues and feature requests
2. Clearly describe the proposed feature
3. Explain the problem it solves
4. Provide use cases and examples
5. Consider implementation complexity

## Development Process

### Branch Management

**Branch Naming Convention:**
- `feature/description` - New features
- `bugfix/issue-number` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/critical-issue` - Critical production fixes
- `release/version` - Release preparation
- `docs/topic` - Documentation changes

**Branch Workflow:**
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Make changes in your branch
4. Submit a pull request to `main`

### Code Review Process

**Review Requirements:**
- All PRs require at least one code review
- Automated quality gates must pass
- Security scanning must pass
- Tests must pass on all platforms
- Architectural review for significant changes

**Quality Gates:**
- TypeScript compilation without errors
- ESLint and Prettier compliance
- Test coverage above 80%
- Security scan with no critical issues
- Performance benchmarks within limits

### Pull Request Guidelines

**PR Requirements:**
- Clear, descriptive title
- Detailed description of changes
- Related issues referenced
- Tests included for new functionality
- Documentation updated
- Memory bank files updated

**PR Checklist:**
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] Tests added/updated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Memory bank files updated
- [ ] No breaking changes (or migration provided)
- [ ] Security considerations addressed

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Standards

**Language Requirements:**
- All new code must be TypeScript
