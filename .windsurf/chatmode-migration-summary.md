# Chatmode Migration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the migration of chatmodes from Kilocode to Windsurf recipes for the Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel project.

## Chatmodes to Migrate

Based on the kilocode.json file and the GitHub chatmode files, the following chatmodes need to be migrated to Windsurf recipes:

1. Architect
2. Ask
3. Code
4. Debug
5. Deployer
6. Orchestrator
7. Reviewer
8. Security
9. Tester
10. Data Scientist

## Migration Approach

Each chatmode will be migrated to a Windsurf recipe that:
1. Maintains the core responsibilities and guidelines
2. Preserves the memory bank integration patterns
3. Adapts the tool usage guidelines to Windsurf
4. Keeps the project context references
5. Follows Windsurf recipe formatting conventions

## Next Steps

1. Migrate remaining chatmodes to Windsurf recipes
2. Validate all migrated recipes
3. Ensure consistent memory bank integration across all recipes
4. Verify tool usage guidelines are appropriate for Windsurf
