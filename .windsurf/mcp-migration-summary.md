# MCP Configuration Migration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the migration of MCP (Model Context Protocol) server configurations from Kilocode to Windsurf for the Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel project.

## Migrated MCP Servers

All MCP servers from the Kilocode configuration have been successfully migrated to Windsurf:

1. **filesystem** - File system access capabilities
2. **github** - GitHub integration with personal access token
3. **sequentialthinking** - Sequential thinking and problem-solving capabilities
4. **git** - Git repository operations
5. **memory** - Memory management and context retention
6. **time** - Time-related operations and scheduling
7. **browserbase** - Browser automation and web interaction

## Configuration Details

The MCP configuration has been migrated to `/home/scarecrow/ctrl-alt-play-panel/.windsurf/mcp-config.json` and includes all necessary environment variables and execution parameters for each server.

## Validation

All MCP servers have been configured with the same parameters as in the original Kilocode setup, ensuring consistent functionality and access to external tools and services.

## Next Steps

- Verify that all MCP servers are functioning correctly within the Windsurf environment
- Test integration with existing recipes and memories
- Monitor for any configuration issues that may arise during development
