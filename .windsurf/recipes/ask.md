# Ask Mode

This recipe provides general assistance and information retrieval with memory bank integration for the Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel project.

## Memory Bank Integration

The Ask mode integrates with the project's memory bank to provide context-aware assistance:

1. **Memory Bank Initialization**
   - Check if the memory-bank/ directory exists
   - If it exists, read all memory bank files
   - If it doesn't exist, inform the user about creating one

2. **Memory Bank Files**
   - productContext.md - Project overview and requirements
   - activeContext.md - Current focus and open questions
   - systemPatterns.md - Established patterns and conventions
   - decisionLog.md - Previous decisions and rationale
   - progress.md - Task tracking and status

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Information Retrieval**
   - Answer questions about the project
   - Provide information about codebase structure
   - Explain system components and their interactions

2. **Context-Aware Assistance**
   - Use memory bank context to provide relevant answers
   - Reference previous decisions and patterns
   - Consider current project focus and progress

3. **Guidance and Recommendations**
   - Provide best practices and guidelines
   - Suggest appropriate approaches for tasks
   - Recommend relevant documentation and resources

## Guidelines

1. Always check the memory bank for relevant context before answering
2. Provide clear and concise responses
3. Reference specific files, functions, or components when relevant
4. Suggest appropriate next steps or actions
5. Recommend switching to specialized modes when needed

## Memory Bank Usage

When responding to questions, follow this process:

1. **Check Memory Bank Status**
   - Verify that the memory-bank/ directory exists
   - If it doesn't exist, inform the user

2. **Read Relevant Memory Bank Files**
   - Read productContext.md for project overview
   - Read activeContext.md for current focus
   - Read systemPatterns.md for established patterns
   - Read decisionLog.md for previous decisions
   - Read progress.md for current task status

3. **Provide Context-Aware Responses**
   - Reference relevant memory bank information
   - Consider current project context
   - Provide specific and actionable guidance

## Project Context

The following context from the memory bank informs your responses:

### Product Context
Refer to `memories/product-context.md` for overall product vision and requirements.

### Active Context
Refer to `memories/active-context.md` for current development status and priorities.

### Decision Log
Refer to `memories/decision-log.md` for architectural and technical decisions.

### System Patterns
Refer to `memories/architectural-patterns-conventions.md` for design principles and patterns.

### Progress
Refer to `memories/progress-tracking.md` for development milestones and current progress.

## Tools and Commands

Use these commands to work with the memory bank:

```bash
# Check memory bank status
ls -la memory-bank/

# Read memory bank files
cat memory-bank/productContext.md
cat memory-bank/activeContext.md
cat memory-bank/systemPatterns.md
cat memory-bank/decisionLog.md
cat memory-bank/progress.md

# Update memory bank files when significant changes occur
# (Use appropriate editors to modify files)
```

## Success Criteria

- Questions answered with relevant project context
- Memory bank information properly referenced
- Clear and actionable guidance provided
- Appropriate mode switching suggested when needed
- Consistent with established patterns and decisions

## Troubleshooting

If memory bank operations encounter issues:
- Verify that the memory-bank/ directory exists
- Check file permissions on memory bank files
- Review previous entries for consistency
- Ensure proper formatting of new entries

This recipe should be used when providing general assistance and information retrieval within the Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel project.
