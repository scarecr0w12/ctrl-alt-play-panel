# System Stabilization Plan: Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel

## Executive Summary

This plan addresses the critical test suite failures (44 failing tests) that are blocking deployment of the Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel. The failures are primarily due to database mocking issues, service constructor errors, and TypeScript compilation problems. All new feature development is suspended until these issues are resolved.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Test Suite Failures (44 tests failing)
- **Database Mocking Issues**: Test database setup and teardown problems
- **Service Constructor Errors**: SteamWorkshopService and other services failing to instantiate
- **TypeScript Compilation Problems**: Type errors and missing declarations

### 2. Deployment Blockers
- Application startup crashes due to service constructor failures
- Inability to verify multi-database support functionality
- Broken integration between core services

## Stabilization Approach

### Phase 1: Triage and Categorization (Day 1)

1. **Failure Analysis**
   - Categorize all 44 failures by type:
     - Database/mocking issues
     - Service constructor errors
     - TypeScript compilation errors
     - Integration test failures
     - Unit test failures

2. **Root Cause Identification**
   - Identify common patterns in failures
   - Determine if there are shared root causes
   - Prioritize based on impact and frequency

3. **Documentation**
   - Create detailed failure report with error messages
   - Map failures to specific components/services
   - Establish baseline for tracking progress

### Phase 2: Critical Fixes (Days 2-5)

1. **Service Constructor Issues**
   - Fix SteamWorkshopService constructor failure
   - Address all service instantiation problems
   - Verify dependency injection is working correctly

2. **Database Mocking**
   - Repair test database setup and teardown
   - Fix foreign key handling in test environment
   - Ensure proper isolation between tests

3. **TypeScript Compilation**
   - Resolve all type errors
   - Fix missing declarations and imports
   - Address implicit any type issues

### Phase 3: Integration and Verification (Days 6-7)

1. **Test Suite Validation**
   - Run all tests to verify fixes
   - Address any remaining failures
   - Ensure no regressions introduced

2. **Deployment Verification**
   - Test all deployment methods (CLI, web installer, quick-deploy)
   - Verify multi-database support functionality
   - Confirm application startup without crashes

3. **Documentation Update**
   - Update progress tracking
   - Refresh memory bank files
   - Document lessons learned

## Detailed Task Breakdown

### Database Mocking Issues
- Fix test database setup in `tests/setup.ts`
- Repair foreign key handling in test environment
- Ensure proper cleanup between tests
- Verify Prisma mock implementation

### Service Constructor Errors
- Fix SteamWorkshopService constructor
- Address AgentService instantiation failures
- Repair MappingService constructor issues
- Verify all service dependencies are properly injected

### TypeScript Compilation Errors
- Resolve implicit any type errors
- Fix missing declarations
- Address import/require conflicts
- Correct type mismatches

### Integration Test Failures
- Repair mock service implementations
- Fix WebSocket context issues
- Address authentication mock problems
- Verify API route testing

## Success Criteria

1. **Test Suite**: All 100 tests passing (0 failures)
2. **Application Startup**: No crashes on startup
3. **Deployment**: All deployment methods working correctly
4. **Multi-Database Support**: Functionality verified across all supported databases
5. **Documentation**: Updated progress tracking and memory bank files

## Timeline

- **Day 1**: Triage and categorization
- **Days 2-5**: Critical fixes implementation
- **Days 6-7**: Integration, verification, and documentation

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risks
1. **Complex Root Causes**: Issues may be more complex than initially identified
2. **Cascading Failures**: Fixing one issue may reveal others
3. **Time Overruns**: More time may be needed than allocated

### Mitigations
1. **Daily Checkpoints**: Review progress and adjust approach as needed
2. **Incremental Testing**: Test fixes as they're implemented
3. **Backup Plan**: Revert to last known stable commit if needed

## Next Steps

1. Immediately begin failure analysis and categorization
2. Create detailed issue tracking for each failure type
3. Start with highest priority fixes (service constructors)
4. Establish daily progress checkpoints

This stabilization plan takes priority over all other development work until the system is stable and all tests are passing.
