# Architectural Patterns and Conventions - Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel

## Mandatory Architectural Patterns

### Panel+Agent Distributed Architecture

The system follows a strict Panel+Agent distributed architecture pattern:

1. **Central Panel** manages multiple external Agents across nodes with fault isolation and scalability
2. **Communication** via HTTP REST API and WebSocket real-time events with JWT authentication
3. **Database Layer** with PostgreSQL/Prisma ORM for centralized data
4. **Service Discovery** with automatic agent detection

### API Requirements

- RESTful design with consistent response formats
- Proper HTTP methods and status codes
- Standardized error handling and validation
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

### Permission System

The system implements 36 granular permissions across 10 categories:
- SERVER_*: Server management permissions
- USER_*: User management permissions
- FILE_*: File system permissions
- PLUGIN_*: Plugin system permissions
- WORKSHOP_*: Steam Workshop permissions
- BACKUP_*: Backup and restore permissions
- ANALYTICS_*: Analytics and reporting permissions
- SYSTEM_*: System-level permissions
- NETWORK_*: Network configuration permissions
- MONITORING_*: Monitoring and alerting permissions

### Component Separation

Clear boundaries are maintained between:
- Panel and Agent components
- Frontend and Backend layers
- Service and Data access layers
- Business logic and Presentation layers

### Deployment Patterns

- Docker multi-stage builds for optimized images
- Environment-agnostic infrastructure
- Health monitoring and status reporting
- Automated scaling and resource management

### Breaking Change Protocol

- Backward compatibility requirements
- Migration strategies for existing deployments
- Version deprecation timelines
- Communication plans for affected users

## Project-Specific Conventions

### Memory Bank Integration

All significant changes must update memory bank files with the required format:

**Required Sections:**
- **Context**: Background and rationale for the change
- **Decision**: What was decided and why
- **Implementation**: How the decision was implemented

**Required Files:**
- systemPatterns.md
- api.md
- database.md
- testing.md
- productContext.md
- activeContext.md
- decisionLog.md
- progress.md

### Plugin System

The plugin system follows a 5-phase development process:

1. **Planning**: Requirements analysis and design
2. **Core Implementation**: Basic functionality development
3. **Integration**: Connection with core system services
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive validation and security review
5. **Documentation**: User guides and API documentation

**Plugin Certification Process:**
- Security validation and code review
- Performance benchmarking
- Resource usage limits enforcement
- Compatibility testing

### Agent Communication

Standardized communication protocols between Panel and Agents:

- **Message Formats**: Consistent JSON structures
- **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Regular status updates
- **Command Validation**: Input sanitization and verification
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error responses

### Security Protocols

Comprehensive security measures are implemented throughout the system:

- **File Operation Validation**: Boundary checks for all file operations
- **Console Command Filtering**: Dangerous operations (shutdown, rm -rf, etc.) are blocked
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Authentication Security**: JWT with httpOnly cookies to prevent XSS
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control with granular permissions
- **Data Protection**: Encryption for sensitive data at rest and in transit

### Testing Environment

Environment-agnostic testing with complete isolation:

- **External Service Mocking**: All external services are mocked
- **Database Test Isolation**: Separate test databases with proper cleanup
- **Network Mocking**: Network calls are intercepted and simulated
- **Cross-Platform Validation**: Testing across Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS

### Deployment Standards

Production-ready deployment configurations:

- **Environment Variable Validation**: Required variables are checked
- **Health Check Endpoints**: Comprehensive status monitoring
- **Graceful Shutdown Handling**: Proper cleanup on termination
- **Resource Management**: CPU and memory limits enforcement

### Monitoring

Comprehensive monitoring and observability:

- **Logging**: Structured logging with context information
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time resource usage tracking
- **Error Tracking**: Exception monitoring and alerting
- **Agent Status Monitoring**: Distributed system health checks

## Implementation Standards

### Coding Standards

1. **TypeScript Only**: ALL NEW CODE must be TypeScript with strict mode
2. **No 'any' Types**: Explicit typing required with interfaces for objects, types for unions
3. **File Naming**: Backend camelCase (userService.ts), Frontend PascalCase components (UserDashboard.tsx), kebab-case pages (user-profile.tsx)
4. **Code Organization**: Barrel exports via index.ts, default exports for main components, named exports for utilities/types
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks, custom error classes, proper HTTP status codes, logging with context
6. **Async Patterns**: async/await over Promises, proper error handling, no callback hell
7. **Database**: Prisma ORM patterns, transaction handling, proper relations
8. **Testing**: Jest with comprehensive coverage, integration tests, mocking patterns
9. **Security**: Input validation, SQL injection prevention, XSS protection, CSRF tokens
10. **Performance**: Lazy loading, code splitting, database optimization, caching strategies

### Database Standards

1. **Prisma ORM**: Primary database access layer
2. **Multi-Database Support**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, SQLite
3. **Migration Patterns**: Version-controlled schema changes
4. **Connection Management**: Efficient connection pooling
5. **Data Validation**: Input validation at the database layer
6. **Security**: Proper indexing, query optimization, access controls

### API Standards

1. **RESTful Design**: Consistent resource-based URLs
2. **HTTP Semantics**: Proper use of methods and status codes
3. **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control
4. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation
6. **Versioning**: Backward-compatible API versions

### Frontend Standards

1. **React/Next.js**: Modern component-based architecture
2. **TypeScript**: Strict typing throughout
3. **State Management**: React Context API for global state
4. **Styling**: TailwindCSS with consistent design system
5. **Performance**: Lazy loading and code splitting
6. **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance and keyboard navigation
7. **Security**: XSS prevention and input sanitization
