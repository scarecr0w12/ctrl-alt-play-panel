- Primary production database
- Full feature support
- Best performance and reliability

### MySQL / MariaDB
- Compatible alternative
- Good performance
- Wide adoption

### MongoDB
- Document-based flexibility
- Schema-less development
- Horizontal scaling

### SQLite
- Development and testing
- Lightweight deployments
- Single-file database

## Containerization

### Docker Multi-Stage Builds

- Optimized image sizes
- Security scanning integration
- Cross-platform support (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
- Environment-agnostic deployment

### Docker Compose Profiles

Dynamic profile selection for different database types:
- postgres
- mysql
- mariadb
- mongodb
- sqlite

### Health Monitoring

- Container health checks
- Service status reporting
- Performance metrics
- Resource usage tracking

## Troubleshooting Guide

### PostgreSQL Connection Issues

**Problem:** Application can't reach PostgreSQL at postgres:5432

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure PostgreSQL container is running
2. Verify container is properly linked
3. Check Docker network configuration
4. Validate service discovery

### Database Compatibility Issues

**Problem:** Previous PostgreSQL version 16 data incompatible with version 15

**Solution:** Updated docker-compose.yml to use postgres:16-alpine

### Container Restarting Issues

**Problem:** Main application container restarting due to database connection failure

**Solution:** Fix database connectivity before application starts

### Environment Configuration Issues

**Problem:** Incorrect database connection parameters

**Solution:** Check .env file for correct DATABASE_URL configuration

### Docker Network Issues

**Problem:** Containers cannot communicate

**Solution:** Ensure containers are on same Docker network for service discovery
