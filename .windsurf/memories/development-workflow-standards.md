# Development Workflow Standards - Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel

## Branch Management

The project follows strict branch naming conventions and management practices:

### Branch Naming Conventions
- **feature/description**: New feature development
- **bugfix/issue**: Bug fixes and patches
- **hotfix/critical**: Critical production fixes
- **release/version**: Release preparation branches
- **docs/topic**: Documentation updates

### Branch Management Process
- All branches are created from the main branch
- Mandatory checkpoints and approvals before merging
- Regular code reviews and architectural validation
- Automated quality gates for all changes

## Code Review Process

### Automated Quality Gates
- ESLint for code style and quality
- TypeScript compilation with strict mode
- Security scanning for vulnerabilities
- Performance benchmarking

### Peer Review Requirements
- All code changes require peer review
- Architectural review for significant changes
- Security review for authentication/authorization changes
- Performance review for resource-intensive operations

## Testing Pipeline

The project implements a comprehensive testing pipeline:

### Test Types
1. **Unit Tests**: Component-level testing with Jest
2. **Integration Tests**: Cross-component testing with 21 integration tests
3. **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability assessment and code analysis
4. **Performance Validation**: Resource usage and response time testing

### Testing Patterns
- **Mock Service Pattern**: Complete external service mocking for environment-agnostic testing
- **Test Database Pattern**: Isolated test database with proper cleanup and foreign key handling
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Validation across Ubuntu, Windows, macOS environments
- **CI/CD Pipeline Pattern**: Automated testing with security scanning and deployment validation

## CI/CD Automation

### Continuous Integration
- Automated code quality checks on every commit
- Vulnerability assessment and dependency audit
- Docker builds and image validation
- Deployment readiness validation

### Continuous Deployment
- Automated release process
- Environment validation before deployment
- Health checks and rollback procedures
- Monitoring setup and alert configuration

## Quality Gates

All changes must pass these quality gates:

1. **TypeScript Compilation**: Strict mode with no errors
2. **Test Coverage**: Minimum coverage thresholds met
3. **Security Scan**: No critical or high severity issues
4. **Performance Benchmarks**: Resource usage within acceptable limits
5. **Code Review**: Approval from required reviewers
6. **Architectural Review**: Validation of design patterns

## Deployment Process

### Pre-Deployment
- Environment validation and configuration check
- Health check endpoint verification
- Dependency and service connectivity validation

### Deployment
- Automated deployment with rollback capability
- Health checks during and after deployment
- Monitoring and alert setup
- Performance baseline validation

### Post-Deployment
- Smoke testing of critical functionality
- Monitoring dashboard verification
- User access and permission validation

## Documentation Requirements

### API Documentation
- Updates to API documentation with new endpoints
- Example requests and responses
- Error code documentation

### Memory Bank Maintenance
- Updates to systemPatterns.md with new patterns
- API documentation in api.md
- Database schema changes in database.md
- Testing documentation in testing.md
- Product context in productContext.md
- Active context in activeContext.md
- Architectural decisions in decisionLog.md
- Progress tracking in progress.md

### User Documentation
- Updates to README.md and other public docs
- Installation and configuration guides
- User guide updates for new features
- Troubleshooting documentation
