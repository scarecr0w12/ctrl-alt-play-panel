# Public Directory

This directory previously contained the old HTML-based frontend files. These have been moved to the `backup/` subdirectory.

## Migration Complete ✅

The Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel has been fully migrated to a modern React/Next.js frontend located in the `/frontend/` directory with enterprise-grade security.

### Current System Architecture:
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js with permission-aware UI (`http://localhost:3001`)
- **Backend**: Node.js/TypeScript with advanced RBAC (`http://localhost:3000`)  
- **Security**: 36 granular permissions, real-time monitoring, audit trails
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with comprehensive permission models

### Frontend Locations:
- **New React Frontend**: `http://localhost:3001` (port 3001)
- **Backend API**: `http://localhost:3000` (port 3000)
- **Security Dashboard**: `http://localhost:3000/api/monitoring/security/dashboard`

### Old HTML Files:
All old HTML files have been moved to `./backup/` for archival purposes:
- `console.html` → Now: React `/console` page with permission controls
- `dashboard.html` → Now: React `/dashboard` page with real-time monitoring
- `files.html` → Now: React `/files` page with file management permissions
- `index.html` → Now: React `/` page with role-based interface
- `login.html` → Now: React `/login` page with enhanced security
- `register.html` → Now: React `/register` page with permission assignment

### Backend Route Changes:
The backend now redirects all old HTML routes to the React frontend automatically and enforces permission-based access control.

### Security Features:
- ✅ **36 Granular Permissions** across 10 categories
- ✅ **Role-based Access Control** (USER → MODERATOR → ADMIN)
- ✅ **Real-time Security Monitoring** with automated alerting
- ✅ **Comprehensive Audit Trails** with detailed logging
- ✅ **Permission-aware UI** with dynamic rendering
- ✅ **Session Management** with automatic cleanup
