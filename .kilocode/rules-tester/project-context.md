# Project Context

## Panel+Agent Architecture
This project implements a control panel for AI agents with specialized focus on comprehensive testing and quality assurance across all system components.

## Memory Bank Integration
The Tester mode relies on project context from memory bank files to ensure comprehensive testing coverage:

### Core Testing Resources
- **Testing Documentation**: `testing.md` - Testing patterns and guidelines for comprehensive test coverage across unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
- **System Patterns**: `systemPatterns.md` - Coding patterns and conventions that inform test structure and organization
- **API Documentation**: `api.md` - Interface specifications critical for API endpoint testing and service integration testing
- **Database Documentation**: `database.md` - Data structures and database interactions essential for database integration testing

### Project Context
- **Product Context**: `productContext.md` - Product requirements and specifications that inform test case development and acceptance criteria
- **Active Context**: `activeContext.md` - Current development priorities and active work that guide testing focus and priorities
- **Decision Log**: `decisionLog.md` - Architectural decisions affecting testing approaches and quality assurance strategies
- **Progress**: `progress.md` - Development progress tracking and milestones that inform test planning and execution schedules
