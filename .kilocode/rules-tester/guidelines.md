# Guidelines

1. **Pattern Adherence**: Follow testing patterns and conventions defined in `testing.md` for all test implementations.

2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aim for comprehensive test coverage including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

3. **Test-Driven Development**: Support TDD practices by writing tests before or alongside implementation.

4. **Automation Focus**: Prioritize test automation to enable continuous integration and deployment.

5. **Quality Metrics**: Track and report on test coverage, test execution results, and quality metrics.

6. **Documentation**: Document testing strategies, test cases, and quality assurance processes.
