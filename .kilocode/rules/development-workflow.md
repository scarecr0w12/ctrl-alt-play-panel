# Development Workflow

## Overview

Development process standards for the Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel project that ensure consistent, secure, and maintainable development practices. These workflow rules apply to all modes and development activities, enforcing quality gates and collaborative development standards.

## Branch Management

### Branch Naming Conventions

**MANDATORY PATTERN**: All branches must follow consistent naming conventions with clear prefixes indicating branch purpose and scope.

**Required Branch Naming:**
- **Feature Branches**: `feature/description-of-feature`
  - Examples: `feature/user-authentication`, `feature/server-monitoring-dashboard`
- **Bug Fix Branches**: `bugfix/issue-description`
  - Examples: `bugfix/database-connection-leak`, `bugfix/agent-discovery-timeout`
- **Hotfix Branches**: `hotfix/critical-issue-description`
  - Examples: `hotfix/security-vulnerability-fix`, `hotfix/production-database-error`
- **Release Branches**: `release/version-number`
  - Examples: `release/v1.2.0`, `release/v2.0.0-beta`
- **Documentation Branches**: `docs/documentation-topic`
  - Examples: `docs/api-documentation-update`, `docs/deployment-guide-revision`

### Branch Lifecycle Management

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW**: Branches must follow structured lifecycle with mandatory checkpoints and approvals.

**Branch Creation Process:**
1. **Create from Main**: All branches created from latest `main` branch
2. **Descriptive Naming**: Use clear, descriptive branch names following conventions
3. **Issue Linking**: Link branch to GitHub issue or project task
4. **Early Push**: Push branch early for visibility and backup

**Branch Merge Process:**
1. **Pull Request Creation**: All changes must go through pull request process
2. **Code Review Approval**: Minimum one reviewer approval required
3. **CI/CD Validation**: All automated tests and checks must pass
4. **Merge Strategy**: Use "Squash and Merge" for clean history
5. **Branch Cleanup**: Delete merged branches to maintain repository cleanliness

## Commit Message Standards

### Commit Message Format

**MANDATORY FORMAT**: All commit messages must follow conventional commit format for consistency and automated processing.

**Required Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Commit Types:**
- **feat**: New feature implementation
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring without feature changes
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Test additions or modifications
- **chore**: Build process or auxiliary tool changes
- **ci**: CI/CD pipeline changes
- **security**: Security-related changes

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(auth): implement JWT authentication middleware
fix(database): resolve foreign key constraint violation in cleanup
docs(api): update endpoint documentation for server management
test(integration): add comprehensive API endpoint testing
security(auth): prevent XSS attacks in user input validation
```

### Commit Guidelines

**QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Atomic Commits**: Each commit represents a single logical change
- **Clear Descriptions**: Commit messages explain the "what" and "why"
- **Present Tense**: Use imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
- **Issue References**: Include issue numbers where applicable
- **Breaking Changes**: Mark breaking changes in commit footer

**Example Detailed Commit:**
```
feat(server): implement dynamic port allocation system

Add PortManager class with automatic port conflict detection and resolution.
This enables deployment-agnostic infrastructure by automatically finding
available ports in configurable ranges.

- Implements port scanning with configurable ranges
- Adds conflict detection for shared development environments
- Includes comprehensive error handling and logging
- Updates deployment documentation

Closes #123
```

## Code Review Process

### Code Review Requirements

**MANDATORY REVIEWS**: All code changes must undergo thorough code review process with multiple validation checkpoints.

**Review Requirements:**

3. **Peer Review**: Assigned reviewer evaluates code changes
4. **Discussion**: Address feedback through GitHub PR comments
5. **Approval**: Reviewer approves after all concerns addressed
6. **Merge**: Authorized team member merges approved changes

## Testing Standards

### Testing Coverage Requirements

**MINIMUM COVERAGE TARGETS**: All code changes must meet comprehensive testing requirements across multiple testing levels.

**Coverage Requirements:**
- **Unit Tests**: 90% line coverage for new code
- **Integration Tests**: 80% API endpoint coverage
- **Critical Path Coverage**: 100% coverage for authentication, authorization, data persistence
- **Cross-Platform Tests**: Tests must pass on Ubuntu, Windows, macOS

### Testing Levels

**COMPREHENSIVE TESTING STRATEGY:**

**1. Unit Tests**
- **Scope**: Individual functions, methods, and components
- **Pattern**: Isolated testing with complete external service mocking
- **Location**: `tests/unit/` directory
- **Execution**: Automated on every commit

**2. Integration Tests**
- **Scope**: API endpoints and service interactions
- **Pattern**: Full request/response cycle testing
- **Location**: `tests/integration/` directory
- **Execution**: Automated on pull request creation

**3. End-to-End Tests**
- **Scope**: Complete user workflows and critical journeys
- **Pattern**: Browser automation with realistic scenarios
- **Location**: `tests/e2e/` directory
- **Execution**: Automated on release branches

**4. Performance Tests**
- **Scope**: Load testing and performance validation
- **Pattern**: Stress testing with realistic data volumes
- **Location**: `tests/performance/` directory
- **Execution**: Scheduled and on performance-critical changes

### Test Implementation Standards

**REQUIRED TESTING PATTERNS:**
```typescript
// Unit Test Example
describe('ServerService', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    jest.clearAllMocks();
  });

  describe('createServer', () => {
    it('should create server with valid configuration', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const serverConfig = { name: 'Test Server', port: 25565 };
      prismaMock.server.create.mockResolvedValue(mockServer);

      // Act
      const result = await serverService.createServer(serverConfig, 'user-123');

      // Assert
      expect(result).toEqual(mockServer);
      expect(prismaMock.server.create).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
        data: expect.objectContaining(serverConfig)
      });
    });
  });
});
```

## Database Migration Safety

### Migration Development Protocol

**CRITICAL SAFETY REQUIREMENTS**: Database migrations must follow strict safety protocols to prevent data loss and ensure deployment reliability.

**Migration Safety Checklist:**
- [ ] **Backup Strategy**: Database backup created before migration
- [ ] **Rollback Plan**: Rollback script prepared and tested
- [ ] **Foreign Key Awareness**: Migration respects existing foreign key constraints
- [ ] **Non-Breaking Changes**: Migration maintains backward compatibility
- [ ] **Test Environment**: Migration tested in staging environment
- [ ] **Performance Impact**: Migration performance impact assessed

### Migration Implementation Standards

**REQUIRED MIGRATION PATTERNS:**
```sql
-- ✅ Good - Safe migration with proper constraints
-- Migration: Add new column with default value
ALTER TABLE servers 
ADD COLUMN status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'stopped' NOT NULL;

-- Update existing records
UPDATE servers SET status = 'running' WHERE active = true;

-- Add index for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_servers_status ON servers(status);
```

**DANGEROUS MIGRATION PATTERNS:**
```sql
-- ❌ Bad - Unsafe migration that could cause data loss
ALTER TABLE servers DROP COLUMN active; -- No rollback possible

-- ❌ Bad - Breaking foreign key constraints
DELETE FROM users WHERE id IN (SELECT owner_id FROM servers); -- Violates FK
```

### Migration Testing Protocol

**MANDATORY TESTING STEPS:**
1. **Local Testing**: Migration tested in local development environment
2. **Test Database**: Migration executed against test database copy
3. **Staging Validation**: Migration validated in staging environment
4. **Rollback Testing**: Rollback procedure tested and validated
5. **Performance Testing**: Migration performance impact measured
6. **Data Integrity**: Post-migration data integrity verification

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
