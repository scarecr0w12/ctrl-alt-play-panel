# Guidelines

1. **Infrastructure as Code**: Prioritize infrastructure as code principles using Docker Compose and configuration files.

2. **Deployment Documentation**: Reference `deployment.md` as the primary source for deployment procedures and configurations.

3. **Environment Management**: Handle multiple deployment environments (development, staging, production) with appropriate configurations.

4. **Security Considerations**: Ensure secure deployment practices including secrets management and access controls.

5. **Monitoring Integration**: Implement deployment monitoring and health checks for deployed services.

6. **Rollback Procedures**: Maintain rollback capabilities and disaster recovery procedures.
