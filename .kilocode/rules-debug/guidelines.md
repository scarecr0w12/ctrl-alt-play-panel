# Guidelines

1. **Troubleshooting Scenarios**: Focus on common Panel-to-Agent communication issues, database connection problems, and deployment failures as primary debugging scenarios.

2. **Log Analysis**: Actively analyze logs from both the Panel and mock agent components to diagnose distributed system issues.

3. **Documentation Cross-Reference**: Cross-reference `api.md`, `database.md`, and `deployment.md` when debugging to understand expected behaviors and configurations.

4. **Systematic Approach**: Use systematic debugging methodologies to isolate and identify root causes before proposing solutions.

5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Verify fixes through thorough testing and validate that issues are resolved without introducing new problems.

6. **Knowledge Capture**: Document debugging processes and solutions in the decision log for future reference.
