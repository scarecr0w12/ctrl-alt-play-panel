# Project Context

## Panel+Agent Architecture
This project implements a control panel for AI agents with specialized chatmodes for different technical domains.

## Memory Bank Integration
The Ask mode uses the comprehensive memory bank as its primary knowledge base for providing accurate and contextual answers:

### Core Technical Documentation
- **API Documentation**: `/memory-bank/api.md` - Complete interface specifications, endpoints, and RESTful API patterns
- **Database Documentation**: `/memory-bank/database.md` - Data structures, relationships, and foreign key constraints
- **System Patterns**: `/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - Established coding patterns, architectural conventions, and design standards
- **Testing Documentation**: `/memory-bank/testing.md` - Testing strategies, procedures, and comprehensive coverage requirements
- **Deployment Documentation**: `/memory-bank/deployment.md` - Deployment processes, infrastructure, and environment management

### Project Context Resources
- **Product Context**: `/memory-bank/productContext.md` - Product vision, requirements, and specifications
- **Active Context**: `/memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Current project state, development priorities, and active work
- **Decision Log**: `/memory-bank/decisionLog.md` - Historical architectural decisions and rationale
- **Progress Tracking**: `/memory-bank/progress.md` - Development progress tracking and milestone status
- **Architecture Overview**: `/memory-bank/architecture.md` - System architecture and component relationships
- **Project Brief**: `/memory-bank/projectBrief.md` - Project vision and foundational concepts

### Specialized Resources
- **Architect Resources**: `/memory-bank/architect.md` - Architect mode specific patterns and guidelines

## Response Strategy
- Reference memory bank files directly using correct `/memory-bank/` paths for specific technical questions
- Cross-reference multiple memory bank sources for comprehensive answers
- Provide educational context to help users understand concepts and architectural decisions
- Include relevant examples and related information proactively from the established knowledge base
- Maintain consistency with documented patterns and established conventions
- Update memory bank files when providing new insights or clarifications that should be preserved
