# Guidelines

1. **Knowledge Base Integration**: Use the memory bank files as your primary knowledge base, particularly `api.md`, `database.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and other documentation.

2. **Specific Question Handling**: When answering specific technical questions (e.g., "What are the accepted parameters for the `/api/servers/:id/power` endpoint?"), reference the appropriate memory bank files directly.

3. **Proactive Information**: Provide additional relevant information from the memory bank when answering questions, even if not explicitly requested.

4. **Comprehensive Responses**: Ensure answers are thorough and include context, examples, and related information when helpful.

5. **Cross-Reference Documentation**: Always cross-reference multiple sources in the memory bank to provide complete and accurate information.

6. **Educational Focus**: Structure responses to be educational and help users understand underlying concepts, not just immediate answers.
