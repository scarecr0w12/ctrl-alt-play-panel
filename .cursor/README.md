## 🤖 **Custom Modes**

We've configured 10 specialized AI agents for different development roles:

### Core Development Modes
- **🏗️ System Architect** - Panel+Agent architecture design and technical decisions
- **💻 TypeScript Expert** - Type-safe development for frontend and backend
- **🔧 Plugin Developer** - Plugin ecosystem development and SDK usage
- **🚀 DevOps Specialist** - Docker, CI/CD, and infrastructure management

### Specialized Modes  
- **🔒 Security Auditor** - Enterprise security standards and vulnerability assessment
- **🗄️ Database Expert** - Multi-database architecture and Prisma ORM
- **🧪 Testing Engineer** - Comprehensive testing strategies and automation
- **📡 API Designer** - RESTful APIs and WebSocket communication protocols
- **🎨 Frontend Specialist** - React/Next.js and responsive UI development  
- **📚 Documentation Writer** - Technical documentation and user guides

## 🔧 **MCP Servers**

Our MCP configuration includes 12 integrated servers for enhanced development capabilities:

### Core Development
- **GitHub** - Repository management and GitHub API integration
- **Filesystem** - Secure file operations with configurable access controls  
- **Git** - Git repository interaction and automation
- **Memory** - Persistent memory system for AI context

### Documentation & Code Intelligence
- **Context7** - Up-to-date code documentation for libraries and frameworks
- **Sequential Thinking** - Dynamic problem-solving through thought sequences

### Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Docker** - Container management through Docker API
- **PostgreSQL** - Database interaction and query execution
- **SQLite** - Local database operations and testing

### Automation & Integration
- **Time** - Timezone conversion and scheduling capabilities
- **Browserbase** - Browser automation and web scraping
- **Vibe Check** - Custom project-specific utilities

## 📋 **Rule System**

Our rule system is organized into 7 categories with specific purposes:

### Core Rules (Always Apply)
- **Rule Generation System** - Maintains consistent rule creation and management
- **Memory Bank System** - Ensures persistent context across AI sessions
- **TypeScript Strict Standards** - Enforces TypeScript-only development

### Auto-Apply Rules (File Pattern Based)  
- **Naming Conventions** - Consistent file and directory naming
- **Docker Standards** - Container and deployment best practices

### Agent-Selected Rules (Contextual)
- **Panel+Agent Architecture** - Distributed system design guidelines

### Manual Rules (On-Demand)
- Created as needed for specific procedures or advanced techniques

## 🧠 **Memory Bank System**

The memory bank provides persistent project context across AI sessions:

### Required Files
- **projectContext.md** - Project overview and business context
- **activeContext.md** - Current development focus and recent changes  
- **systemPatterns.md** - Architecture patterns and technical decisions
- **techContext.md** - Technology stack and development constraints
- **progress.md** - Current status, completed features, and known issues
- **decisionLog.md** - Architectural decisions with timestamps and rationale

### Memory Bank Benefits
- **Session Continuity** - AI maintains context across interactions
- **Project Knowledge** - Comprehensive understanding of project goals
- **Decision History** - Track of architectural choices and reasoning
- **Status Awareness** - Current progress and priority understanding

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### 1. Verify Configuration
Ensure all MCP servers are properly configured and accessible:
```bash
# Test Docker availability
docker --version

# Verify Node.js for npm-based servers  
node --version

# Check Python for uvx-based servers
python3 --version
```

### 2. Initialize Memory Bank
If this is your first time using the system:
1. Open Cursor
2. Use the "System Architect" mode
3. Request: "Initialize memory bank"
4. The AI will read and set up the complete memory bank system

### 3. Select Appropriate Mode
Choose the right custom mode for your task:
- **Planning & Architecture**: System Architect
- **Code Implementation**: TypeScript Expert or Plugin Developer  
- **Infrastructure Work**: DevOps Specialist
- **Security Review**: Security Auditor
- **Documentation**: Documentation Writer

### 4. Leverage MCP Tools
The AI can automatically use MCP tools when relevant:
- GitHub operations for repository management
- Docker commands for container operations
- Database queries for data analysis
- Context7 for library documentation
- And many more...

## 🔄 **Migration Notes**

This configuration migrates and consolidates settings from:

### From VSCode
- Basic settings and TypeScript configuration
- MCP server configurations
- Extension recommendations

### From Windsurf  
- Rules for development workflow
- Memory system concepts
- MCP configurations

### From Kilocode
- Extensive rule system with specialized domains
- Custom mode definitions
- Architectural patterns and coding standards

### From GitHub
- Workflow configurations  
- Issue and PR templates
- Chat mode definitions

## 🛠️ **Customization**

### Adding New Rules
Use the rule generation system by requesting:
```
"Create a rule for [specific behavior or pattern]"
```

### Extending Custom Modes
Modify `.cursor/modes.json` to add new specialized roles or update existing ones.

### Adding MCP Servers
Update `.cursor/mcp.json` with new server configurations. Refer to the [MCP server registry](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) for available options.

### Memory Bank Updates
The memory bank automatically updates, but you can manually trigger updates by requesting:
```
"Update memory bank"
```

## 📊 **Performance Optimization**

### Rule Efficiency
- Rules are organized by frequency of use
- Auto-apply rules for fundamental standards
- Agent-selected rules for contextual guidance
- Manual rules for specialized procedures

### MCP Server Management
- Servers load on-demand to minimize resource usage
- Docker-based servers provide isolation and security
- Local servers for frequently used tools (git, filesystem)

### Memory Bank Optimization
- Hierarchical file structure for efficient AI comprehension
- Regular updates maintain accuracy and relevance
- Focused content keeps context window usage optimal

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues
1. **MCP Server Connection Failures**
   - Verify Docker is running for Docker-based servers
   - Check network connectivity for remote servers
   - Validate environment variables and API keys

2. **Rule Application Issues**
   - Restart Cursor to reload rule configurations
   - Verify rule file syntax and frontmatter format
   - Check rule categorization and naming conventions

3. **Custom Mode Problems**
   - Validate JSON syntax in modes.json
   - Ensure proper group assignments (read, edit, browser, command, mcp)
   - Restart Cursor after making changes

### Getting Help
- Check the memory bank for project-specific context
- Use the "Documentation Writer" mode for assistance
- Refer to individual MCP server documentation for specific issues

## 📈 **Next Steps**

1. **Familiarize** yourself with the custom modes and their specialized capabilities
2. **Experiment** with different MCP servers to understand their functionality  
3. **Contribute** new rules as you discover patterns that should be standardized
4. **Monitor** the memory bank to ensure it stays current with project evolution
5. **Optimize** the configuration based on your specific development patterns
