## Project Architecture

The Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel employs a modern, distributed architecture that separates concerns between the central management panel and external agents. This design represents a significant architectural evolution from the project's original monolithic approach.

### Panel+Agent Distributed Architecture

The system follows a distributed Panel+Agent pattern similar to Pelican Panel/Wings, consisting of two primary components:

1. **Panel (Central Management)**:
   - Serves as the web interface and API backend
   - Handles user management, authentication, and authorization
   - Manages server configurations and settings
   - Coordinates communication with distributed agents
   - Aggregates monitoring data and metrics
   - Provides the administrative dashboard

2. **External Agents (Node Execution)**:
   - Run as separate projects on individual nodes/machines
   - Handle Docker container lifecycle management
   - Execute game server operations (start/stop/restart)
   - Perform file operations on the node
   - Collect and report metrics to the panel
   - Operate independently with fault tolerance

### Communication Protocol

The Panel and Agents communicate through:
- **HTTP REST API**: For standard operations and agent management
- **WebSocket**: For real-time events, console streaming, and status updates
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure communication with token-based auth
- **Agent Discovery**: Automatic detection and registration of agents

### Key Architectural Characteristics

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear division between user interface/management (Panel) and execution (Agents)
- **Scalability**: Multiple agents can be deployed across different infrastructure
- **Reliability**: Agents can restart independently without affecting the panel
- **Security**: Authenticated communication with proper isolation
- **Flexibility**: Support for various agent implementations (Node.js, Go, Python, etc.)
- **Fault Tolerance**: Graceful handling of agent disconnections and failures

### System Components

The architecture consists of several key components:

- **Panel Server**: Node.js/Express application with TypeScript
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js with static export
- **Agent Communication**: ExternalAgentService and AgentDiscoveryService
- **Security Layer**: JWT authentication with RBAC
- **Monitoring System**: Real-time metrics collection and visualization
- **File Management**: Remote file operations through agents
- **Console Access**: Real-time terminal access to game servers

This distributed architecture enables the system to scale horizontally, improve fault isolation, and provide better separation of concerns compared to the previous monolithic approach.

The diagram illustrates the distributed nature of the system, with the Panel Server handling the web interface, API, and coordination, while the External Agents manage Docker containers and file operations on their respective nodes. The WebSocket connection enables real-time communication between the Panel and Agents, while the REST API provides standard operations. The Agent Discovery Service allows for automatic detection and registration of agents across the infrastructure.
