# Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel: System Architect

## Overview
This file contains the architectural decisions and design patterns for the Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel project, focusing on the distributed Panel+Agent architecture and deployment-agnostic infrastructure.

## Core Architectural Decisions

### 1. **Panel+Agent Distributed Architecture**
**Decision**: Implement distributed architecture with central Panel managing multiple external Agents
**Rationale**: 
- Provides better scalability and fault isolation compared to monolithic approaches
- Enables deployment across multiple nodes with independent agent operation
- Allows for rolling updates and maintenance without system-wide downtime
- Supports heterogeneous infrastructure with agents on different platforms

### 2. **Deployment-Agnostic Infrastructure Design**
**Decision**: Build system to deploy on any Linux distribution without dependencies
**Rationale**:
- Eliminates infrastructure lock-in and vendor dependencies
- Enables deployment in shared development environments without conflicts
- Reduces operational overhead and deployment complexity
- Supports diverse hosting environments from development to enterprise

### 3. **Dynamic Port Management System**
**Decision**: Implement automatic port detection and conflict resolution
**Rationale**:
- Essential for shared development environments with multiple projects
- Prevents deployment failures due to port conflicts
- Enables zero-configuration deployment scenarios
- Supports containerized deployments with dynamic port allocation

### 4. **Environment-Agnostic Testing Strategy**
**Decision**: Complete mocking of external services (Prisma, Redis, Steam API)
**Rationale**:
- Enables testing in any environment without external dependencies
- Ensures consistent CI/CD pipeline execution across platforms
- Reduces test setup complexity and improves developer productivity
- Eliminates test failures due to external service unavailability

### 5. **TypeScript-First Development**
**Decision**: Use TypeScript throughout frontend and backend
**Rationale**:
- Provides compile-time type safety reducing runtime errors
- Improves developer experience with better IDE support
- Enables better refactoring and maintenance capabilities
- Aligns with modern web development best practices

### 6. **Security-First Authentication Architecture**
**Decision**: JWT with httpOnly cookies and comprehensive RBAC
**Rationale**:
- Prevents XSS attacks through httpOnly cookie implementation
- Provides stateless authentication suitable for distributed systems
- Enables granular permission control with 36 distinct permissions
- Supports audit trails and session management

### 7. **Static Frontend Export Strategy**
**Decision**: Use Next.js static export instead of server-side rendering
**Rationale**:
- Enhanced security through elimination of server-side execution
- Improved performance with CDN-friendly static assets
- Simplified deployment without Node.js runtime requirements
- Better caching and reduced server resource usage

### 8. **Docker Multi-Stage Build Pattern**
**Decision**: Implement multi-stage Docker builds with platform support
**Rationale**:
- Optimizes container size by excluding development dependencies
- Supports multiple architectures (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
- Enables consistent builds across different environments
- Facilitates CI/CD pipeline integration

### 9. **Agent Communication via HTTP REST**
**Decision**: Use HTTP REST API for Panel-Agent communication
**Rationale**:
- Provides language-agnostic communication protocol
- Enables agents to be implemented in different technologies
- Simplifies firewall configuration and network troubleshooting
- Supports standard HTTP authentication and security practices

### 10. **Plugin System JavaScript/TypeScript Focus**
**Decision**: Phase 1 plugin system supports only JavaScript/TypeScript
**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing Node.js/React ecosystem and dependencies
- Provides fastest execution and easiest development experience
- Enables deep integration with panel functionality
- Future expansion to multi-language support via API bridge

## Design Pattern Implementations

### Repository Pattern with Prisma ORM
- Abstracts database access through service layer
- Provides type-safe database operations
- Enables easy testing through mock implementations
- Supports database migration and schema evolution

### Middleware Chain for Cross-Cutting Concerns
- Authentication and authorization handling
- Request logging and error handling
- Rate limiting and security headers
- CORS configuration and validation

### Event-Driven Architecture for Real-Time Features
- WebSocket connections for live console streaming
- Real-time server status updates
- Event aggregation for monitoring and analytics
- Pub/sub pattern for distributed notifications

## Infrastructure Architecture

### Container Orchestration Strategy
- Docker containers for consistent deployment
- Environment variable configuration
- Health check implementations
- Automatic restart and recovery policies

### Database Architecture
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Foreign key constraint management
- Migration-based schema evolution
- Backup and recovery procedures

### Security Architecture
- Multi-layered security approach
- JWT token management with rotation
- Role-based access control implementation
- Comprehensive audit logging

## Performance Considerations

### Scalability Patterns
- Horizontal scaling through agent distribution
- Database connection pooling
- Caching strategies with Redis
- CDN integration for static assets

### Monitoring and Observability
- Health check endpoints
- Performance metrics collection
- Error tracking and alerting
- Resource usage monitoring

## Future Architecture Evolution

### Multi-Language Plugin Support
- API bridge for non-JavaScript plugins
- Sandboxed execution environments
- Plugin marketplace and distribution
- Version management and compatibility

### Cloud-Native Enhancements
- Kubernetes deployment support
- Service mesh integration
- Auto-scaling capabilities
- Multi-region deployment patterns

### Enterprise Features
- Advanced RBAC with custom roles
- Audit trail enhancements
- Integration with external identity providers
- High availability and disaster recovery

This architectural foundation provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable platform for game server management while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements and evolving requirements.
