# Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel: System Architecture

## Overview

This document contains the architectural decisions, design patterns, and component structure for the Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel game server management system. The architecture follows security-first principles with a single-service design optimized for game server administration.

## Architectural Decisions

- Adopted Panel+Agent distributed architecture for better scalability and separation of concerns
- Implemented external agent communication via HTTP REST API instead of embedded services
- Added automatic agent discovery service for seamless node integration
- Used Prisma ORM for type-safe database operations
- Implemented comprehensive RBAC with 36 granular permissions
- Integrated WebSocket for real-time updates and monitoring
- Used JWT with httpOnly cookies for secure authentication



- Panel+Agent distributed architecture with WebSocket communication
- Agent-based Docker container management for server isolation
- JSON/YAML egg configuration system for game server templates
- JWT-based authentication between Panel and Agents
- REST API + WebSocket hybrid communication protocol



### Core Architecture Decisions

1. **Single-Service Architecture**: Express.js backend serving both API and static frontend files for simplified deployment and maintenance
2. **Static Frontend Export**: Next.js static export over server-side rendering for enhanced security and performance
3. **PostgreSQL with Prisma**: Relational database over NoSQL for data integrity and type safety in game server management
4. **JWT with httpOnly Cookies**: Secure authentication over localStorage to prevent XSS token exposure
5. **Glass Morphism Design**: Modern UI/UX design system for professional gaming aesthetic
6. **Docker Multi-stage Builds**: Optimized production images with minimal attack surface

## Design Considerations

- Security-first approach with comprehensive audit trails and monitoring
- Scalable architecture supporting multiple agents across distributed infrastructure
- Fault tolerance with graceful agent disconnection handling
- Real-time communication for responsive user experience
- Type safety throughout the application with TypeScript
- Production-ready with Docker containerization and monitoring



- Security: JWT tokens with expiration for Panelâ†”Agent auth
- Scalability: Multiple Agents per Panel for distributed deployment
- Real-time updates: WebSocket for live server status and logs
- Configuration management: Git-based egg repository system
- Error handling: Graceful degradation when Agents disconnect
- Performance: Efficient message routing and connection pooling



- Security-first architecture with proper input validation
- Scalable single-service design with clear separation of concerns
- WebSocket integration for real-time features
- Docker containerization for consistent deployment
- Static frontend export for enhanced security
- Role-based access control throughout the system
