# Current Context

## Current Focus

The current development focus is on completing the external agent integration, which is the final step in the architectural transformation to a fully distributed system. This involves:

1. **Console Integration with External Agents**: Implementing real-time console access through external agents
2. **File Management via External Agents**: Enabling remote file operations through the agent system
3. **Real-time WebSocket Communication Replacement**: Enhancing the WebSocket protocol for agent communication
4. **Configuration Deployment through Agents**: Streamlining configuration management via agents

## Recent Changes

- Successfully implemented backend external agent communication via HTTP REST API
- Created agent discovery service for automatic detection and registration
- Implemented agent management API endpoints
- Developed frontend integration with agent management dashboard
- Created pull request #32 for frontend external agent integration
- Enhanced servers page with agent status indicators
- Added external agent API client with TypeScript interfaces
- Created useAgents React hook for state management

## Current Status

- PR #32 for frontend external agent integration is currently under review
- Backend implementation of external agent communication is complete
- Agent discovery service is operational
- Agent management API endpoints are implemented
- Frontend integration with agent management dashboard is ready for review

## Next Steps

1. Review and merge PR #32 for frontend external agent integration
2. Implement console integration with external agents
3. Develop file management capabilities via external agents
4. Create real-time WebSocket communication replacement
5. Implement configuration deployment through agents
