This provides better security (no URI parameter exposure), modern UI/UX with glass morphism design, improved authentication flow, and better maintainability while preserving the security benefits of static file serving. |
| 2025-07-24 | Single-Service Architecture Adopted | Refactored project to focus on Panel Server only, removing agent system to separate project. This simplifies deployment, reduces complexity, and allows for better focus on core panel functionality. Agents will connect externally via WebSocket. |
| 2025-07-24 | Updated .gitignore and created .dockerignore for comprehensive project exclusions | Enhanced .gitignore with comprehensive Node.js, TypeScript, React/Next.js, and Prisma exclusions. Created .dockerignore to optimize Docker build context by excluding development files, documentation, version control, and build artifacts that shouldn't be in production containers. This improves build performance and security. |
| 2025-07-24 | Adopt Panel+Agent architecture pattern similar to Pelican Panel/Wings for distributed game server management | Research shows Panel+Agent systems provide superior scalability, security, and modularity. Panel handles web interface and user management, while lightweight Agents on each node handle Docker container lifecycle. This architecture allows multi-node deployment, better resource isolation, and GitOps-friendly configuration management through eggs (YAML/JSON config files). |
| 2025-07-24 | Complete Issue #27 implementation with Panel+Agent distributed architecture | Successfully implemented server start/stop/restart controls using Panel+Agent communication pattern. Features include: WebSocket-based command routing, JWT authentication, proper database status updates, user permission validation, comprehensive error handling, and automated testing. This establishes the foundational architecture for all future Panel+Agent interactions and meets all success criteria for Issue #27. |
| 2025-07-24 | Update shared Agent integration documentation with breaking changes from Issue #27 | The new Panel+Agent command protocol introduced breaking changes that require Agent-side updates. Updated the shared documentation file to clearly communicate the required changes, provide implementation examples, and establish a migration timeline. This ensures smooth coordination between Panel and Agent development teams and prevents integration issues. |
| 2025-07-24 | Documentation Standardization: Consolidated duplicate README files into single comprehensive documentation emphasizing Panel+Agent distributed architecture | Multiple README variants were causing confusion and inconsistency. Single source of truth provides clear onboarding path for developers and accurately represents current Panel+Agent system architecture with proper feature documentation and development workflows. |
| 2025-07-24 | GitHub Issues Updated for Panel+Agent Architecture: Updated critical issues to reflect completed Panel+Agent implementation and architecture changes | Issues #27, #28, and #12 needed updating to accurately reflect the current state of Panel+Agent implementation. Issue #27 marked as completed, others updated with architectural context and dependencies. This ensures GitHub project management accurately represents the Panel+Agent distributed system progress. |
| 2025-07-24 | Implemented comprehensive real-time monitoring dashboard with WebSocket integration | Successfully integrated socket.io for real-time communication between React frontend and Node.js backend. The implementation includes: (1) WebSocketContext for managing connections and state, (2) Real-time metrics display with visual indicators, (3) Backend monitoring scheduler for automatic data collection, (4) Proper event handling for metrics:update and server:status events. This provides users with live system monitoring without manual page refreshes. |
| 2025-07-24 | Completed full migration from old HTML system to React frontend | Successfully eliminated all old HTML files and replaced them with modern React components. All backend routes now redirect to the React frontend running on port 3001.
