# Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel: Product Overview

## Why This Project Exists

The Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel was created to address the need for a modern, secure, and user-friendly game server management solution. Existing solutions often lack enterprise-grade security features, have outdated user interfaces, or don't provide the flexibility needed for distributed server management. This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution that prioritizes security, usability, and scalability.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Many existing game server panels have security issues or outdated authentication methods. Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel implements enterprise-grade security with JWT authentication, 36 granular permissions, comprehensive audit trails, and real-time security monitoring.

2. **Distributed Management Complexity**: Managing game servers across multiple physical nodes is challenging. The Panel+Agent distributed architecture allows centralized management of servers running on different machines.

3. **User Experience Limitations**: Older panels often have outdated, non-responsive interfaces. The modern React/Next.js frontend with glass morphism design provides an intuitive, responsive experience across all devices.

4. **Limited Monitoring Capabilities**: Game server administrators need real-time insights. The WebSocket-based monitoring system provides live updates on server status, resource usage, and performance metrics.

5. **Configuration Management Challenges**: Server configuration can be complex and error-prone. The Ctrl-Alt system (inspired by Pterodactyl's eggs/nests) provides template-based configuration with environment variables and Docker settings.

## How It Should Work

The Ctrl-Alt-Play Panel follows a distributed Panel+Agent architecture:

1. **Central Panel**: Web interface and API backend that handles:
   - User authentication and authorization with RBAC
   - Server configuration and template management
   - Monitoring and metrics aggregation
   - Agent discovery and communication

2. **External Agents**: Separate processes running on server nodes that handle:
   - Docker container lifecycle management
   - File system operations
   - Resource monitoring and reporting
   - Direct server control (start/stop/restart)

3. **Communication Flow**:
   - Panel sends commands to Agents via HTTP REST API
   - Agents execute commands and report status back to Panel
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket for monitoring and console access
   - Automatic agent discovery for seamless node integration

4. **Security Model**:
   - JWT authentication with secure httpOnly cookies
   - 36 granular permissions across 10 categories
   - Resource ownership validation
   - Comprehensive audit trails and security logging
   - Session management with IP tracking
